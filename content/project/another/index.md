The Hotel Management System was a web-based project specifically designed to cater to the needs of Pakistani hotels across various cities, with a particular focus on enhancing the tourism industry. Developed primarily using WordPress, this system was created as part of a course project to streamline hotel operations, improve guest experiences, and boost overall efficiency. It includes features such as online booking, room management, customer service tools, and detailed analytics to help hoteliers better understand and serve their guests. The system was tailored to meet the unique requirements of the Pakistani tourism sector, ensuring that hotels can provide top-notch services to both local and international tourists.
