abstract: Automated vehicles (AV) are transforming the future of the transportation
  and improving the quality of life. However, due to their societal impact in urban
  environments, AV development challenges the current development process. Particularly,
  it is unclear how human factors requirements can be communicated to developers of
  AI-based AV. It is quite challenging especially in agile development, where the
  focus is on continuous deployment and rapid release cycles with short lead-times.
  Due to the importance of human factors and its impact on trust, acceptance, and
  safety of AV in urban environments, my work aims at providing a suitable requirements
  engineering perspective and method.
