 abstract = {Automated vehicles (AV) are transforming the future of the transportation and improving the quality of life. However, due to their societal impact in urban environments, AV development challenges the current development process. Particularly, it is unclear how human factors requirements can be communicated to developers of AI-based AV. It is quite challenging especially in agile development, where the focus is on continuous deployment and rapid release cycles with short lead-times. Due to the importance of human factors and its impact on trust, acceptance, and safety of AV in urban environments, my work aims at providing a suitable requirements engineering perspective and method.},
