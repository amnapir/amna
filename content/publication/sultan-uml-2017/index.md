abstract: Recently many significant improvements have been done in traditionally power
  system. But still a lot of work is needed in traditional power system to mend many
  challenges. We propose formal method based on subnet model for smart power system.
  Formal method is mathematics based technique that is used to develop, specify and
  verify model in a systematic manner. It involve components i.e., power plant, smart
  grid, transformer and smart meters. Power plant produces electricity and then distributes
  it to the smart grid. Smart grid generates electricity to transformers and then
  transformers transfer electricity to smart meters. Smart transformers and smart
  meters are deployed inform of subnets that increase the energy efficiency of smart
  power system. In this paper our main focus is on two components of smart power system
  that is transformers and smart meters. Graph theory is used for the semi-formal
  representation of model. In this paper we present system requirements through UML
  use case diagrams that are used to describe actions of system and then real topology
  is transferred into model topology in graph theory that is used to represent the
  structure of system. Mathematical technique and notation based formal method approaches
  are used for describing and analyzing the system. VDM-SL formal method language
  is used for formal specification and VDM toolbox is used for the verification and
  analysis of system.
