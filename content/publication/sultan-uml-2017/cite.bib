 abstract = {Recently many significant improvements have been done in traditionally power system. But still a lot of work is needed in traditional power system to mend many challenges. We propose formal method based on subnet model for smart power system. Formal method is mathematics based technique that is used to develop, specify and verify model in a systematic manner. It involve components i.e., power plant, smart grid, transformer and smart meters. Power plant produces electricity and then distributes it to the smart grid. Smart grid generates electricity to transformers and then transformers transfer electricity to smart meters. Smart transformers and smart meters are deployed inform of subnets that increase the energy efficiency of smart power system. In this paper our main focus is on two components of smart power system that is transformers and smart meters. Graph theory is used for the semi-formal representation of model. In this paper we present system requirements through UML use case diagrams that are used to describe actions of system and then real topology is transferred into model topology in graph theory that is used to represent the structure of system. Mathematical technique and notation based formal method approaches are used for describing and analyzing the system. VDM-SL formal method language is used for formal specification and VDM toolbox is used for the verification and analysis of system.},
