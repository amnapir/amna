abstract: Due to the technical complexity and social impact, automated vehicle (AV)
  development challenges the current state of automotive engineering practice. Research
  shows that it is important to consider human factors (HF) knowledge when developing
  AVs to make them safe and accepted. This study explores the current practices and
  challenges of the automotive industries for incorporating HF requirements during
  agile AV development. We interviewed ten industry professionals from several Swedish
  automotive companies, including HF experts and AV engineers. Based on our qualitative
  analysis of the semi-structured interviews, a number of current approaches for communicating
  and incorporating HF knowledge into agile AV development and associated challenges
  are discussed. Our ﬁndings may help to focus future research on issues that are
  critical to effectively incorporate HF knowledge into agile AV development.
