abstract: 'This work provides a summary of work within the project SHAPE-IT (Supporting
  the interaction of Humans and Automated vehicles: Preparing for the Environment
  of Tomorrow) concerning HMI design for pedestrians, cyclists, and to some extent
  car drivers. We present the lessons learned from doctoral candidates (ESRs) who
  were involved with HMI design using augmented reality and connectivity. The lessons
  learned, which are discussed in this work, relate to if and how human-machine-interface
  (HMI) information should be presented to end users. The underlying philosophy is
  that through augmented reality (AR) and connectivity, virtual information in the
  form of warnings, instructions, and affordances can essentially be displayed at
  any location in the environment, or even be removed from the environment, to, for
  example, create transparent objects. However, just because something falls within
  the realm of technical possibilities and is theoretically interesting, does not
  imply that users will understand the information and can process it efficiently,
  or whether they would find it worthwhile and acceptable compared to no information
  or more traditional forms of HMI communication. This deliverable should serve as
  a useful reference for researchers and HMI designers who are involved in road transport.
  The report is structured as a core with accompanying already published journal articles
  as appendices.'
