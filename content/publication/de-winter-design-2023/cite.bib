 abstract = {This work provides a summary of work within the project SHAPE-IT (Supporting the interaction of Humans and Automated vehicles: Preparing for the Environment of Tomorrow) concerning HMI design for pedestrians, cyclists, and to some extent car drivers. We present the lessons learned from doctoral candidates (ESRs) who were involved with HMI design using augmented reality and connectivity. The lessons learned, which are discussed in this work, relate to if and how human-machine-interface (HMI) information should be presented to end users. The underlying philosophy is that through augmented reality (AR) and connectivity, virtual information in the form of warnings, instructions, and affordances can essentially be displayed at any location in the environment, or even be removed from the environment, to, for example, create transparent objects. However, just because something falls within the realm of technical possibilities and is theoretically interesting, does not imply that users will understand the information and can process it efficiently, or whether they would find it worthwhile and acceptable compared to no information or more traditional forms of HMI communication. This deliverable should serve as a useful reference for researchers and HMI designers who are involved in road transport. The report is structured as a core with accompanying already published journal articles as appendices.},
