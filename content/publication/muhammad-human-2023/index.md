abstract: Automated Vehicle (AV) technology has evolved significantly both in complexity
  and impact and is expected to ultimately change urban transportation. Due to this
  evolution, the development of AVs challenges the current state of automotive engineering
  practice, as automotive companies increasingly include agile ways of working in
  their plan-driven systems engineering—or even transition completely to scaled-agile
  approaches. However, it is unclear how knowledge about human factors (HF) and technological
  knowledge related to the development of AVs can be brought together in a way that
  effectively supports today’s rapid release cycles and agile development approaches.
  Based on semistructured interviews with ten experts from industry and two experts
  from academia, this qualitative, exploratory case study investigates the relationship
  between HF and AV development. The study reveals relevant properties of agile system
  development and HF, as well as the implications of these properties for integrating
  agile work, HF, and requirements engineering. According to the findings, which were
  evaluated in a workshop with experts from academia and industry, a culture that
  values HF knowledge in engineering is key. These results promise to improve the
  integration of HF knowledge into agile development as well as to facilitate HF research
  impact and time to market.
