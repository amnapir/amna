abstract: This Deliverable summarises the work of ESRs 1, 5, 7 and 12 of the SHAPE-IT
  project that considered how a range of human states such as attention, fatigue and
  mental workload are affected by SAE Level 2 and 3 automated vehicles (AVs), when
  compared to manual driving, and what this means for AV and road safety. The studies
  also consider how AV safety and acceptance can increase with Human Machine Interface
  (HMI) transparency, and what factors contribute to the improvement of this transparency.
  An investigation of what aspects of an AVâ€™s HMIs, its driving environment and driving
  style, contribute to the perceived safety, comfort and trust for its users is provided,
  and new methods and frameworks for enhancing these states are introduced. By considering
  how human factors concepts and knowledge should be embraced by software developers
  and AV engineers, ESRs 8 and 15 highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary
  approach to AV development. Finally, the work of ESR2 focuses on how AV trust, acceptance,
  and transparency changes with prolonged and repeated use of AVs, emphasising that
  successful deployment of AVs must embrace human factors knowledge during all stages
  of AV development. This work also highlights that as long as AVs require human interaction
  and intervention, including a diverse user group, and ensuring the appropriate level
  of trust is built at each stage of the interaction, will improve the correct and
  safe use of AVs.
