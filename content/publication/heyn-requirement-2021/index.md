abstract: 'Availability of powerful computation and communication technology as well
  as advances in artiﬁcial intelligence enable a new generation of complex, AI-intense
  systems and applications. Such systems and applications promise exciting improvements
  on a societal level, yet they also bring with them new challenges for their development.
  In this paper we argue that signiﬁcant challenges relate to deﬁning and ensuring
  behaviour and quality attributes of such systems and applications. We speciﬁcally
  derive four challenge areas from relevant use cases of complex, AI-intense systems
  and applications related to industry, transportation, and home automation: understanding,
  determining, and specifying (i) contextual deﬁnitions and requirements, (ii) data
  attributes and requirements, (iii) performance deﬁnition and monitoring, and (iv)
  the impact of human factors on system acceptance and success. Solving these challenges
  will imply process support that integrates new requirements engineering methods
  into development approaches for complex, AI-intense systems and applications. We
  present these challenges in detail and propose a research roadmap.'
