 abstract = {Availability of powerful computation and communication technology as well as advances in artiﬁcial intelligence enable a new generation of complex, AI-intense systems and applications. Such systems and applications promise exciting improvements on a societal level, yet they also bring with them new challenges for their development. In this paper we argue that signiﬁcant challenges relate to deﬁning and ensuring behaviour and quality attributes of such systems and applications. We speciﬁcally derive four challenge areas from relevant use cases of complex, AI-intense systems and applications related to industry, transportation, and home automation: understanding, determining, and specifying (i) contextual deﬁnitions and requirements, (ii) data attributes and requirements, (iii) performance deﬁnition and monitoring, and (iv) the impact of human factors on system acceptance and success. Solving these challenges will imply process support that integrates new requirements engineering methods into development approaches for complex, AI-intense systems and applications. We present these challenges in detail and propose a research roadmap.},
