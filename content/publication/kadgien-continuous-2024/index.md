abstract: In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, the success of tools
  and systems relies heavily on their ability to meet the needs and expectations of
  users. User-centered design approaches, with a focus on human factors, have gained
  increasing attention as they prioritize the human element in the development process.
  With the increasing complexity of software-based systems, companies are adopting
  agile development methodologies and emphasizing continuous software experimentation.
  However, there is limited knowledge on how to eﬀectively execute continuous experimentation
  with respect to human factors within this context. This research paper presents
  an exploratory qualitative study for integrating human factors in continuous experimentation,
  aiming to uncover distinctive characteristics of human factors and continuous software
  experiments, practical challenges for integrating human factors in continuous software
  experiments, and best practices associated with the management of continuous human
  factors experimentation.
