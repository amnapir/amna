	abstract = {Automated Vehicle (AV) technology has evolved significantly both in complexity and impact and is expected to ultimately change urban transportation. Due to this evolution, the development of AVs challenges the current state of automotive engineering practice, as automotive companies increasingly include agile ways of working in their plan-driven systems engineering—or even transition completely to scaled-agile approaches. However, it is unclear how knowledge about human factors (HF) and technological knowledge related to the development of AVs can be brought together in a way that effectively supports today’s rapid release cycles and agile development approaches. Based on semistructured interviews with ten experts from industry and two experts from academia, this qualitative, exploratory case study investigates the relationship between HF and AV development. The study reveals relevant properties of agile system development and HF, as well as the implications of these properties for integrating agile work, HF, and requirements engineering. According to the findings, which were evaluated in a workshop with experts from academia and industry, a culture that values HF knowledge in engineering is key. These results promise to improve the integration of HF knowledge into agile development as well as to facilitate HF research impact and time to market.},

	abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, the success of tools and systems relies heavily on their ability to meet the needs and expectations of users. User-centered design approaches, with a focus on human factors, have gained increasing attention as they prioritize the human element in the development process. With the increasing complexity of software-based systems, companies are adopting agile development methodologies and emphasizing continuous software experimentation. However, there is limited knowledge on how to eﬀectively execute continuous experimentation with respect to human factors within this context. This research paper presents an exploratory qualitative study for integrating human factors in continuous experimentation, aiming to uncover distinctive characteristics of human factors and continuous software experiments, practical challenges for integrating human factors in continuous software experiments, and best practices associated with the management of continuous human factors experimentation.},

Research shows that it is important to consider human factors (HF) knowledge when developing AVs to make them safe and accepted. This study explores the current practices and challenges of the automotive industries for incorporating HF requirements during agile AV development. We interviewed ten industry professionals from several Swedish automotive companies, including HF experts and AV engineers. Based on our qualitative analysis of the semi-structured interviews, a number of current approaches for communicating and incorporating HF knowledge into agile AV development and associated challenges are discussed. Our ﬁndings may help to focus future research on issues that are critical to effectively incorporate HF knowledge into agile AV development.},

Based on design science research, this paper investigates critical challenges that arise in large scale agile development from an undefined requirements strategy. We explore potential ways to address these challenges and synthesize the key building blocks of requirements strategies. Our design science research rests on a multiple case study with three industrial cases. We relied on a total of 20 interviews, two workshops, participant observation in two cases, and document analysis in each of the cases to understand concrete challenges and workflows. In each case, we define a requirements strategy in collaboration with process managers and experienced engineers. From this experience, we extract guidelines for defining requirements strategies in agile.},

Such systems and applications promise exciting improvements on a societal level, yet they also bring with them new challenges for their development. In this paper we argue that signiﬁcant challenges relate to deﬁning and ensuring behaviour and quality attributes of such systems and applications. We speciﬁcally derive four challenge areas from relevant use cases of complex, AI-intense systems and applications related to industry, transportation, and home automation: understanding, determining, and specifying (i) contextual deﬁnitions and requirements, (ii) data attributes and requirements, (iii) performance deﬁnition and monitoring, and (iv) the impact of human factors on system acceptance and success. Solving these challenges will imply process support that integrates new requirements engineering methods into development approaches for complex, AI-intense systems and applications. We present these challenges in detail and propose a research roadmap.},

	abstract = {Recently many significant improvements have been done in traditionally power system. But still a lot of work is needed in traditional power system to mend many challenges. We propose formal method based on subnet model for smart power system. Formal method is mathematics based technique that is used to develop, specify and verify model in a systematic manner. It involve components i.e., power plant, smart grid, transformer and smart meters. Power plant produces electricity and then distributes it to the smart grid. Smart grid generates electricity to transformers and then transformers transfer electricity to smart meters. Smart transformers and smart meters are deployed inform of subnets that increase the energy efficiency of smart power system. In this paper our main focus is on two components of smart power system that is transformers and smart meters. Graph theory is used for the semi-formal representation of model. In this paper we present system requirements through UML use case diagrams that are used to describe actions of system and then real topology is transferred into model topology in graph theory that is used to represent the structure of system. Mathematical technique and notation based formal method approaches are used for describing and analyzing the system. VDM-SL formal method language is used for formal specification and VDM toolbox is used for the verification and analysis of system.},

We present the lessons learned from doctoral candidates (ESRs) who were involved with HMI design using augmented reality and connectivity. The lessons learned, which are discussed in this work, relate to if and how human-machine-interface (HMI) information should be presented to end users. The underlying philosophy is that through augmented reality (AR) and connectivity, virtual information in the form of warnings, instructions, and affordances can essentially be displayed at any location in the environment, or even be removed from the environment, to, for example, create transparent objects. However, just because something falls within the realm of technical possibilities and is theoretically interesting, does not imply that users will understand the information and can process it efficiently, or whether they would find it worthwhile and acceptable compared to no information or more traditional forms of HMI communication. This deliverable should serve as a useful reference for researchers and HMI designers who are involved in road transport. The report is structured as a core with accompanying already published journal articles as appendices.},

The studies also consider how AV safety and acceptance can increase with Human Machine Interface (HMI) transparency, and what factors contribute to the improvement of this transparency. An investigation of what aspects of an AV’s HMIs, its driving environment and driving style, contribute to the perceived safety, comfort and trust for its users is provided, and new methods and frameworks for enhancing these states are introduced. By considering how human factors concepts and knowledge should be embraced by software developers and AV engineers, ESRs 8 and 15 highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to AV development. Finally, the work of ESR2 focuses on how AV trust, acceptance, and transparency changes with prolonged and repeated use of AVs, emphasising that successful deployment of AVs must embrace human factors knowledge during all stages of AV development. This work also highlights that as long as AVs require human interaction and intervention, including a diverse user group, and ensuring the appropriate level of trust is built at each stage of the interaction, will improve the correct and safe use of AVs.},
